# Running the App

## Step 1: Make sure React Native Environment is ready

Follow the instructions on the following link to setup react native environment:
https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

## Step 2: Clone the repo and install the necessary dependencies

Run the following commands to clone to your location machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sskdrn/zenweather.git
cd zenweather
```

Install the `npm` dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Configure API keys 

Create a file `.env` at the root of the project directory, and paste the below code snippet and save (after adding your own API key).

```env
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY HERE>
GOOGLE_PLACES_URL=https://places.googleapis.com
GOOGLE_MAPS_URL=https://maps.googleapis.com
GOOGLE_WEATHER_URL=https://weather.googleapis.com
```

## Step 4: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 5: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
npm run android
```

### For iOS

```bash
npm run ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ or devices shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator/devices correctly.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
